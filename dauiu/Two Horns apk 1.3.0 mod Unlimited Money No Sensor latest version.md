## **Two Horns apk mod no sensor**
In the game Two Horns, the term ‚Äúsensor‚Äù can have a couple of different meanings depending on the context. It‚Äôs not a prominently labeled feature in the main menu, but here are the most likely explanations:

1. Sensor as a Device Feature (Mobile Control):
On mobile devices, sensor usually refers to hardware components like the gyroscope or accelerometer.

These sensors may be used in the game to:
Adjust the camera angle based on how the player tilts the device
Provide smoother or more immersive controls
Help with aiming or movement mechanics
So, if sensor controls are enabled, moving or tilting your phone might affect how your character or camera behaves.
