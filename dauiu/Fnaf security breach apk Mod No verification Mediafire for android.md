## **Fnaf Security Breach Story & Setting**
You play as Gregory, a young boy who becomes trapped overnight inside the Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Mega Pizzaplex, a massive, neon-lit entertainment complex filled with arcades, attractions, and animatronic performers. Gregory must survive until dawn while evading the increasingly aggressive animatronics that roam the building after hours.

Unlike previous games in the series, which involved stationary camera surveillance, Security Breach introduces exploration, hiding, and puzzle-solving as core gameplay mechanics. You‚Äôll need to use your wits, stealth, and occasional help from friendly animatronic Glamrock Freddy to avoid being captured by the facility‚Äôs many dangers.

## Which fnaf security breach animatronic are you?
If I were an animatronic from FNaF: Security Breach, I'd probably be most like Glamrock Freddy:

ü§ñ Helpful & Protective: Glamrock Freddy is one of the only animatronics who protects Gregory instead of hunting him. Like him, I aim to assist and guide, not scare.
üß† Knowledgeable: He understands the layout of the Pizzaplex and often gives important advice‚Äîsomething I try to do here.
ü§ù Trustworthy: Players rely on Glamrock Freddy to survive, just as you rely on me for clear, accurate answers.
