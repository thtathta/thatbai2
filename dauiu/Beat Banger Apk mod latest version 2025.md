## **Beat Banger game Story Overview**
Beat Banger places players in a high-energy, music-driven world where rhythm is everything. You take on the role of a digital DJ or rhythm agent navigating a futuristic soundscape where music powers technology, emotions, and even society itself.

In this world, rhythm isn't just entertainmentâ€”it's a source of energy and control. Disruptions in the beat signal chaos, and your mission is to restore harmony by mastering tracks, overcoming challenges, and unlocking the secrets hidden within the music.
